# 'Sequence-to-Graph: Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Representation with Causality Graphs', submission number 2319.

This Github page makes available the code to reproduce de experiments of paper number 2319, ICML 2020.

Notebooks 'graph_inference_springs10.ipynb' and 'graph_inference_cmapss_001.ipynb' contain the code to infer causal graphs with group-lasso penalized learning. Notebooks 'Seq2Graph_springs.ipynb' and 'Seq2Graph_cmapss.ipynb' contain the Seq2Graph learning. 

The data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QXLvoXkFIHcGGiAauAuAnZysD8s4NtVO). The file 'data' can simply be pasted in the file 'ICML2020'.
