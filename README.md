# 'Multivariate Time Series Representation on a Causality Graphs'

Notebooks 'graph_inference_springs10.ipynb' and 'graph_inference_cmapss_001.ipynb' contain the inference of the causal graph with group-lasso penalized learning for respectively dataset 'springs10' and 'cmapss_001'. Notebooks 'Seq2Graph_springs.ipynb' and 'Seq2Graph_cmapss.ipynb' contain the Seq2Graph learning for respectively dataset 'springs10' and 'cmapss_001'. 

The data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QXLvoXkFIHcGGiAauAuAnZysD8s4NtVO). The file 'data' can simply be pasted in the file 'Seq2Graph'. 

The project requires
- Pytorch > 0.4
- Python > 3
